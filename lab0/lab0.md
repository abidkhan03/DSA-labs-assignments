## LaTex Formulas

<!-- Put your formulas here
 $x= [ -b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac) ]/2a$//
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$ -->

#### Hypotenus of a right angle triangle
$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

#### Geometric Series
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i$$

#### Arithematic Series
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## Reflection here
1. For the first time, Latex was difficult for me and I watched multile tutorial videos of Latex implementation, while I started to write the formulas and became confused that how to write.

2. With regards to CodeSpaces, it is a cloud-based development environment that enables programmers to quickly set up and maintain development environments in the cloud. Real-time collaboration, simple access to development tools, and connection with well-known source control systems like GitHub are just a few of the many advantages it offers.
I liked the fact that I can use the same IDE on my local machine and on the cloud. I did not like the fact that I had to use the browser to access the IDE. I would have preferred to use the IDE on my local machine and have the code run on the cloud.
